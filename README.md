Hi, I'm Mateus
I'm a passionate developer with experience in Typescript, Node.js, Python, React.js, React Native, Swift, PHP, and Bash Script. I specialize in performance optimization, building robust integrations, and developing solutions that improve user experience.

Currently, I focus on private projects that generate financial value, so I don't have much time for open source contributions. However, I'm always learning and working on improving the solutions I develop.
